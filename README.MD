### About the repository
- The repository is made to store the code implemented for benchmarking algorithm used for CAS766 Project.

#### About the directories
- CPP
	- Includes the algorithms implemented in C/CPP.
	
	- Includes implementation with pThread/stdThread/OpenMP
	
	- `Display_Only` directory includes code that is simplified for display purposes only, not written for compilation or execution.
	
	- `include` directory includes `header` files written for the project.
	
	- `include_for_cas766` directory includes `header` files from another personal project for convenience.
	
	- `src_mains` directory includes multiple `main.cpp` files written for benchmarking implemented algorithm with the similar but different data format.
	
	- `output` directory is where compiled binary code will be located.
	
	  
	
- GoLang
	- Includes the implemented in GoLang

	  
	
- Test_Samples
	- The directory where test samples needs to be placed
